6.. Portfolio Correlation and Concentration Limits The framework extends beyond single-trade risk to manage portfolio-level risk. 
 Correlation Limits: NIFTY and BANKNIFTY are identified as highly correlated (>0.8). 
A maximum of 3 combined positions across these indices is enforced.
1  Concentration Limit: A hard limit of 10 total F&O positions is enforced across the portfolio.
* System-Wide Emergency Protocols The EA has a "circuit breaker" system triggered by extreme VIX levels :
 * Level 1 (Warning): VIX 30-35. The EA reduces new trade sizes and actively seeks to reduce its total open position count by 50%.
* Level 2 (Critical): VIX > 35. This triggers a system-wide shutdown. 
The EA will close all open positions immediately and revert to Paper Mode
