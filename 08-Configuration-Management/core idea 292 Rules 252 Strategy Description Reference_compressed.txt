Rule 255: Market Type Auto-Detect
 Primary Chart Detection: EA first iden	ndex Options, Stock Options)

  Execution Condition: EA WILL RUN ON parent chart ONLY if market type is identified as true
  Market Categories: Futures, Index Options, Stock Options specifically

Rule 256: Sequential Path Analysis Protocol
  Sequential Execution: EA runs in specific sequence - 1st Continuation path, THEN Pull-back path
  Trend Analysis Hierarchy: First check Major trend (Daily/4H), then Middle trend (1H/30M)
  Parent Chart Operation: All trend analysis occurs on parent chart before secondary chart creation

Rule 257: Multi-Timeframe Trend Validation Framework
  Major Trend Timeframes: Daily (D1) OR 4-Hour (H4) timeframe analysis
  Middle Trend Timeframes: 1-Hour (H1) OR 30-Minute (M30) timeframe analysis
  Validation Requirement: BOTH major and middle trends must be true from either CT or PB path

Rule 258: Option Chain Analysis & Strike Selection
  Trigger Condition: When both major and middle trends are validated true
 Process: EA reads option chain of the asset to determine strike prices
  Selection Priority: First ATM strike price, then slightly OTM strike price (50-points away from ATM)

Rule 259: Dynamic Secondary Chart Creation Protocol
  Chart Creation: EA dynamically opens 2 charts at slightly OTM strike price level
 Chart Types: One Call side chart AND one Put side chart
  Location: At slightly OTM strike price level determined by option chain analysis

266-275: Strike Price Selection Criteria
Rule 260: ATM Strike Price Selection Algorithm
  Primary Criterion: Strike price nearest to current spot price
 OI Difference Requirement: >30% relative difference of Open Interest (OI) between Call side and Put side
  Alternative: Change in OI can be used instead of absolute OI for >30% calculation

Rule 261: OTM Strike Price Selection Algorithm
  Distance Requirement: 1 level away from ATM strike price
  OI Difference Requirement: >30% relative difference between Call side and Put side Open Interest

  Validation: Must also maintain the 1-level distance from ATM requirement

Rule 262: Directional Alignment Validation
 Critical Requirement: Both ATM and OTM strike prices must have >30% OI difference in SAME direction
 Direction Options: Either Call side OR Put side, but must be consistent
 Example: If ATM shows Call side >30%, then OTM must also show Call side >30%

Rule 263: Secondary Chart Configuration
  Call Side Chart: Opens at the determined slightly OTM strike price level
 Put Side Chart: Opens at the same determined slightly OTM strike price level
  EA Integration: Both charts will have EA running after validation checks

Rule 264: Expiry Day Exception Protocol
  Special Rule: On expiry days, secondary charts open at ATM strike price level
  Override: This overrides the normal slightly OTM strike price selection
 Application: Applies to both Call side and Put side charts

Rule 265: Continuous Parent Chart Operation
  Ongoing Process: Parent chart EA keeps running continuously
  Monitoring: Looks for confirmation of major and middle trend in both paths
  Iteration: Proceeds to get next ATM strike price and repeats the process

266-275: Secondary Chart Trading Rules
Rule 266: Secondary Chart EA Execution
 Same EA Logic: Identical EA runs on secondary charts with same sequential approach
  Top-Down Analysis: Find Major trend, then Middle trend, then execute entry

  Allowed Timeframes: Trade entry ONLY in 5-minute OR 15-minute timeframes
