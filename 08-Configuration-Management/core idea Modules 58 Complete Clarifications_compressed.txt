EA GlobalFlow Pro v7.0 - Modules 5-8 Complete Clarifications
?? MODULE 5: ENTRY CONDITIONS - COMPLETE ANSWERS
5.1 34 Conditions Implementation
Q5.1.1: Condition Priority Ranking
Answer: Equal Weight with Quality-Based Enhancement  All 34 conditions have equal weight initially
  Enhancement system provides the tier differentiation:
 Tier 1: Conditions + Triple Enhancement (85%+) = Premium trades  Tier 2: Conditions only (65-75% win rate) = Standard trades
  No dynamic weighting - sequential execution prevents complexity

Q5.1.2: Minimum Condition Threshold
Answer: Fixed 10 Minimum with Market-Specific Adjustments

Standard Markets: 10 out of 17 conditions (same direction) F&O Options: 10 out of 17 (no change due to leverage) High Volatility (VIX >30): 12 out of 17 (increased threshold) Strong Trending: 8 out of 17 (reduced for clear momentum)

Q5.1.3: Condition Conflict Resolution
Answer: Sequential Logic Prevents Conflic  CT path checked first, then PB - no sim
 Buy vs Sell within same path: Skip ass
  Contradiction example: If B5 (CT-Buy)	er ? Skip this bar

5.2 Candlestick Pattern Validation Q5.2.1: Pattern Recognition Timing Answer: Bar Close Validation with Next B

Timing Sequence:
1. Entry conditions met at bar close ?
2. Candlestick pattern validated at same bar close ?
3. Trade executed immediately (no next bar wait)
4. Pattern strength determines position sizing

Q5.2.2: Pattern Strength Scoring (0-100 Scale)
Bullish Pattern Rankings:
1. Three Line Strike (95-100 points) - Strongest reversal
2. Three White Soldiers (85-95 points) - Strong momentum
3. Morning Star (75-85 points) - Reliable reversal
4. Three Inside Up (65-75 points) - Moderate strength
Bearish Pattern Rankings:
1. Three Black Crows (95-100 points) - Strongest bearish
2. Evening Star (85-95 points) - Strong reversal
3. Abandoned Baby (80-90 points) - High reliability
4. Dark Cloud Cover (70-80 points) - Moderate bearish
5. Bearish Harami (65-75 points) - Weak signal
6. Two Black Gapping (75-85 points) - Gap significance

Q5.2.3: Multiple Pattern Handling
Answer: Select Strongest Pattern Only
  Single pattern priority: Choose highest-scoring pattern
  No pattern combination - avoids over-optimization
  Multiple weak patterns < One strong pattern

5.3 Sequential Execution Logic Q5.3.1: Entry Order with 3-Trade Limit Answer: Quality-Based Selection System

python
# 3-Trade Selection Algorithm
def select_best_trades(all_signals): scored_signals = []
for signal in all_signals:
score = calculate_enhancement_score(signal) if score >= 85: # Minimum threshold
scored_signals.append((signal, score))

# Sort by score, select top 3
best_3 = sorted(scored_signals, reverse=True)[:3] return best_3

Q5.3.2: Time-Based Sequencing
Answer: Same Bar Execution with Staggered Risk  All qualified entries within same bar close
 Position sizing scaled: 1st trade 40%, 2nd trade 35%, 3rd trade 25%
 Risk staggering prevents overexposure

Q5.3.3: Cross-Asset Coordination
Answer: Independent Limits per Strike/Asset

F&O Structure:
- 3 trades per Call chart (per strike)
- 3 trades per Put chart (per strike)
- Multiple strikes allowed
- Total F&O portfolio limit: 20 charts (40-60 positions max)

Non-F&O:
- 3 trades per forex/commodity chart
- Independent limits per asset

5.4 Enhancement System Integration
Q5.4.1: Layer Application Order
Answer: Sequential Enhancement with 85% Minimum

Flow: Entry Conditions ? Layer 1 ? Layer 2 ? Layer 3 ? Execute

Layer 1: Candlestick Pattern (40% weight)
Layer 2: Volume Profile (35% weight)
Layer 3: Order Flow (25% weight)

Calculation: (L1×0.4) + (L2×0.35) + (L3×0.25) = 85%

Q5.4.2: Enhancement Failure Handling
Answer: Log and Continue System
  Score 70-84%: Log for analysis, skip trade
  Score <70%: Reject immediately, no logging
  No re-evaluation - avoid over-fitting
  Alert for manual review if patterns emerge Q5.4.3: Options-Specific Enhancements Answer: Add F&O-Specific Layer 4
Layer 4 (F&O Only): Greeks & IV Analysis
- IV Rank: 30-70% optimal range (±15 points)
- Delta Range: 0.30-0.70 optimal (±20 points)
- Time Decay: >7 days to expiry (±10 points)
- Combined F&O Score: L4 must be =60% for options Final F&O Score: [(L1+L2+L3)×0.75] + [L4×0.25] = 85%
