Rule 372: Updated Path Trigger and Option Chain Reading Protocol
 Trigger Condition: When either CT or PB path is TRUE at bar close
  Immediate Action: At bar-close spot price, EA immediately reads option chain
  Time Constraint: Option chain reading within 5 minutes of bar-close spot price discovery
 Asset Scope: Applied to the specific asset being analyzed

Rule 373: Updated ATM Strike Price Selection Criteria
  Primary Condition: Strike price nearest to bar-close spot price
  OI Requirement: >30% relative difference of Open Interest (OI) OR change in OI
