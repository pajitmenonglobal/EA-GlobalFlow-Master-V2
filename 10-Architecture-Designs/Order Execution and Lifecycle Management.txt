Order Execution and Lifecycle Management

This section defines the mechanics of order management, accounting for slippage, partial fills, and broker rejections.1

7.1. Smart Fill Management for Partial Fills

The system includes a protocol for intelligently handling partial fills. Crucially, this logic never involves altering the trade's stop loss
Fill â‰¥ 70%: ACCEPT. The partial fill is accepted, and the unfilled remainder is canceled. The trade proceeds with the smaller size.
Fill < 70%: REJECT. The trade is deemed to have failed. The unfilled remainder is canceled, and the EA immediately sends an order
 to close the small portion that was filled.

7.2. Intelligent Order Retry Logic

If an order fails for a transient reason (e.g., "Re-quote"), the EA engages an intelligent retry system.1
Maximum Attempts: 3 retries.
Progressive Delay: 1 second after the first failure, 3 seconds after the second, and 5 seconds after the third.
Contextual Handling: This logic only applies to recoverable errors. A fatal error like "Insufficient Margin" will not trigger a retry.

7.3. Order Placement for Non-F&O Markets

For Forex and Commodity markets, entries are executed using pending orders to capture breakout momentum.
Order Types: The EA will exclusively use ORDER_TYPE_BUY_STOP and ORDER_TYPE_SELL_STOP orders.1
Customizable Distance: The distance from the current price at which these pending orders are placed is fully customizable
 through external input parameters. This allows for fine-tuning the entry strategy based on the specific asset's volatility and 
the broker's pip/point structure (e.g., IC Markets). The distance is specified in points.1
