? EA Implementation:

NRI Mode Toggle: Input parameter "Enable NRI Mode" (Yes/No)
Symbol Filtering: When NRI mode enabled, restrict currency derivatives to only the 4 permitted pairs
Compliance Check: Automatic validation of currency symbols before trade execution
Alert System: Warning if attempting to trade non-permitted currency derivatives
Dual Configuration:
NRI Mode ON: Only USD-INR, GBP-INR, JPY-INR, EUR-INR allowed

?? Q92 Confirmation Still Needed:
Should I proceed with the complete EA GlobalFlow Pro v6.4 implementation plan including:


All 8 modules + NRI currency derivatives compliance Dual Enhancement System
Complete development roadmap
Ready to finalize the ultimate EA framework! Please confirm Q92! ??Q92 Confirmation Still Needed: please wait? Waiting for Q92 Confirmation
Understood! I'm waiting for your confirmation on Q92 before proceeding with the complete EA GlobalFlow Pro v6.4 implementation plan.
Current Status: ? All 8 Modules Complete (510+ rules documented)
? Dual Enhancement System Confirmed (Candlestick + Volume Profile)
? NRI Currency Derivatives Compliance Added
? Ready for Complete Implementation Planning

Waiting for your Q92 confirmation to proceed with the comprehensive EA development roadmap.
Take your time! ??when I compile the EA in MT5 platform, then it should not open or close new trades.? MT5 Compilation Safety Rule - ACKNOWLEDGED & ACCEPTED!
Perfect! I've added this critical safety feature to the EA framework.

MT5 Compilation Safety Implementation:
? Compilation Detection:

Monitor MT5 compilation events using MQLInfoInteger(MQL_COMPILATION_TIME)
Detect when EA is being recompiled or reloaded
? Trade Restrictions During Compilation: Block NEW trade entries completely Block NEW pending orders
Prevent opening new secondary charts
Halt F&O scanning operations
? Existing Trade Protection:

Continue monitoring existing positions for exit conditions Allow STR-EXIT based trade closures to protect open positions Maintain expiry day force-close functionality (3:29 PM) Keep stop-loss management active
? Implementation Logic:


IF (MT5_Compilation_Detected OR EA_Reloading):
- Block: New entries, new charts, new scanning
- Continue: Exit monitoring, stop-loss, position management
- Status: "COMPILATION MODE - No New Trades"


? Integration Points:

Module 5: Entry conditions check compilation status first Module 4: Secondary chart opening blocked during compilation Module 2: F&O scanning paused during compilation
Module 7: Order management maintains exits only

Safety Benefits:
Prevents uncontrolled trade opening during EA reload Protects existing positions with continued monitoring Maintains risk management integrity
Clear status indication for user awareness

Added to the EA safety framework! Ready for Q92 confirmation when you're ready!

the list of restricted stocks for the NRI-PIS account can be found by visiting the following websites:
* RBI: rbi.org.in/scripts/BS_FiiUSer.aspx
* NSDL: fpi.nsdl.co.in/web/Reports/ForeignInvestmentLimitMonitoringListing
* CDSL: cdslindia.com/publications/FIMonitoring
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) monitors the investment position of NRIs in listed Indian companies daily through designated banks. When the total holdings of NRIs reach 2% below the set upper limit, a notice (caution list) is issued to the designated banks. Any further purchase in that particular Indian company will require prior approval from RBI. The upper limit may be increased with the approval of the board and the general body of the company after passing a special resolution.
If the holdings by NRIs reach the overall ceiling limit, RBI places the company on the ban list, after which NRIs cannot purchase the company's shares under the portfolio investment scheme. NSDL and CDSL also publishes the Red flag list, Caution list, Breach List and Foreign Investment Limits.
