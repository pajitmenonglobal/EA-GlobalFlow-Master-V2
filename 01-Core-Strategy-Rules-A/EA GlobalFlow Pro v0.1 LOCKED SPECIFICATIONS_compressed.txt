EA GlobalFlow Pro v0.1 - LOCKED SPECIFICATIONS
Complete Session Reference & Critical Decisions
Document Status: PERMANENTLY LOCKED 
Date: August 04, 2025
Session: Critical Module Clarifications & Implementation Decisions
Version: EA GlobalFlow Pro v0.1 - Final Locked Framework

 LOCKED MODULE DECISIONS
MODULE SET 2: TRIPLE ENHANCEMENT TIMING - LOCKED 
Q12: ML Confidence Callback Protocols
 LOCKED DECISION:
• No fallback system needed - EA has built-in action choices from project files
• Primary Action: Use stricter traditional conditions (B)
• Context: Project files contain detailed EA decision tree for <75% confidence scenarios
Q13: Enhancement failure Handling
 LOCKED DECISION:
• ML service failure/disconnect protocol: Use mandatory candlestick+volume WITH 34 conditions
• Context: Combined validation approach maintains safety when ML unavailable
Q14: VIX "3O Protocol Adjustments
 LOCKED DECISION: High volatility (India VIX >30) modifications

• ML Threshold: Keep at 750/o(no change)
• Candlestick Requirement: Require STRONGER patterns
• Position Sizing: Dynamic scaling = Normal size x (30/VIk

Q15: Bar-Close Timing Alignment
 PENDING: Timing sequence clarification still needed

 LOCKED WIN RATE ARCHITECTURE: 90-95%
 CORRECTED TRIPLE ENHANCEMENT SYSTEM:
 Normal Mode (ML Active - 90-959a Target):

• Layer 1: 34 Entry Conditions (Base: 70-75%)
• Layer 2: ML Enhancement (Enhanced: 85-90%)
• Layer 3: Candlestick + Volume (Final: 90-95%)

 Callback Mode (ML failed - 85-9096 Target):
• Layer 1: 34 Entry Conditions (Base: 70-75%)
• Layer 2: Skip ML Validation 
• Layer 3: MANDATORY STRICT Candlestick + Volume (Final: 85-90%)

 ADJUSTED EA PARAMETERS FOR 90-95•6 WIN RATE:
 Enhanced MIn1mum Requirements:
Normal Mode (ML Active):

• Minimum Conditions: 12 out of 34 (increased from 10)
• ML Confidence: a80% (increased from 75%)
• Candlestick Pattern: Strong directional required
 • Volume Profile: 1150% average volume Fallback Mode (ML Failed):
• Minimum Conditions: 15 out of 34 (highest threshold)
• Candlestick Pattern: PREMIUM GRADE patterns only
• Volume Profile: 1250% average volume (strictest)
• Indicator Confluence: 5 indicators aligned (vs 4)

 VIX-Based Adjustments (9O-9596 TARGET}:
India VIX *20 (Normal Volatility):

• Standard requirements: 12 conditions + 80% ML + strong patterns

India VIX 20-30 (Elevated Volatility):

• Enhanced requirements: 14 conditions + 85% ML + premium patterns
• Position sizing: Normal x (25/VIX)

India VIX >30 (High Volatility):

• Maximum requirements: 15 conditions + 900/oML + ULTRA-PREMIUM patterns
• Position sizing: Normal	(20/VIX)
• Additional filter: Must have 3+ confirming timeframes


 LOCKED EA LOGIC UNDERSTANDING
 CORRECTED 34 CONDITIONS EXECUTION:
 CONFIRMED UNDERSTANDING:
• Each of the 34 conditions is INDEPENDENT
• Each condition = Complete trade setup by itself
• NOT "X out of Y" - each stands alone
• NO "10 out of 17" logic - that was completely wrong
 TRADE SELECTION LOGIC:
Sequential Process:

Individual Condition Evaluation:
1. Condition Check: Multiple conditions may trigger
2. Enhancement Scoring: Each gets ML + Candlestick + Volume score
3. Execution Decision: Highest scorer wins per asset per strike
4. One-Time Use: Same condition blocked for same strike same day
Example:
• B7 triggers (91% score)	EXECUTED
• B3 triggers (89% score)	DISCARDED
• B12 triggers (83% score)	DISCARDED

 LOCKED F&O TRADE ALLOCATION FRAMEWORK
 PERMANENTLY LOCKED RULES:
 STRATEGIC OPTIMIZATION (LOCKED ):
• 1 trade maximum per same ATM/OTM per asset per day  LOCKED
• 4 trades maximum per Call chart per day (DEFAULT}  LOCKED
• 4 trades maximum per Put chart per day (DEFAULT}  LOCKED
 • Total: Up to 8 trades per F&0 asset per day (4 Call + 4 Put)  LOCKED  CUSTOMIZABLE LIMITS (LOCKED ):


Validation Logic:

• Range: 1-10 trades per side (user configurable)
• Default: 4+4 optimal for NIFTY's 200-point daily range
• Auto-validation: Prevents unreasonable limits

 STRATEGIC ADVANTAGES (LOCKED):
1. Better Strike Distribution - Covers more of NIFTY's range
2. Reduced Concentration Risk - Not betting heavily on single level
3. Higher Trade Frequency - More opportunities across strikes
4. Dynamic Following - Adapts to intraday price movement
5. Optimal Chart Utilization - Maximizes capacity

 LOCKED GRADE-A CANDLESTICK PATTERNS
 GRADE-A BULLISH PATTERNS (LOCKED ):
 STRONG PATTERNS {Weight: 1.0):
1. Three White Soldiers - 3 rising tall green candles, partial overlap, close near high
2. Morning Star - Red -• Small gap -• Green above midpoint (downtrend reversal)
3. Deliberation - 2 tall green + 1 small green near previous close (uptrend continuation)

 RELIABLE PATTERNS {Weight: 0.8):
4. Three Line Strike - 3 falling red + 1 green engulfing all
5. Morning Doji Star - Red - Doji gap - Green above midpoint
6. Three Outside Up - Engulfing green + higher close
7. Engulfing - Red followed by taller green body
8. Belt Hold - Tall green, gaps down, no lower shadow

2. Identical Three Crows - 3 identical falling red, no overlap, close near low
3. Evening Star - Green	Small gap	Red below midpoint (uptrend reversal)
4. Concealing Baby Swallow - 2 red gap -• red with upper shadow	engulfing red
 5. Three Line Strike (Bear) - 3 rising green + 1 red engulfing all  RELIABLE PATTERNS {Weight: 0.8):
6. Falling Three Methods - Red - 3 small bullish	Red closing below first
7. Separating Lines - Green in downtrend - Red opening near first low
8. Doji Star - Bearish continuation in downtrend
