What's Happening:
i.  License data loads successfully (file exists and is readable)
2.  BUT password hash is EMPTY when trying to save
3.  EA overwrites the good password hash with empty data
4.  Next time, no password hash exists to compare against

 The Bug is in SaveLicenseData() Timing:
The Issue:
Password hash gets cleared or not set properly before saving, so the EA saves empty password hash, destroying the previous good one.

 Quick Fix - Prevent Empty Hash Save:

 CRITICAL BUG FIX APPLIED!
What I Fixed:
i.  Prevent empty password hash saves - Never overwrites good data
2.  Return false if attempting to save empty hash
3.  Preserve existing good password data

 Now Test The Fix:
i. Update code (compile)

2. Delete
3 Attach EA with

(fresh start)
(creates good hash)

4. Remove EA and attach again with same password
s Should see: "Authentication successful" (not "first time")

 Expected Results:

This should finally fix the password persistence! Ready to test the bug fix?
