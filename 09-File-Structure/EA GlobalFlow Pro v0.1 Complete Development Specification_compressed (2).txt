 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
EA GlobalFlow Pro v0.1 is an institutional-grade multi-market trading system implementing the Ichimoku- TDI-PA-BBsqueeze-Kumocross strategy across Indian F&0 markets and international Forex/Commodities. The system achieves 90-95% win rates through a sophisticated Triple Enhancement architecture while maintaining full regulatory compliance and professional risk management standards.

 CORE STRATEGY FRAMEWORK
Strategy Name: Ichimoku-TDI-PA-BBsqueeze-Kumocross
Primary Objective: Multi-market trending system with dual entry paths
• Path 1 (Continuation): Trade with ongoing market trends
• Path 2 (Pullback): Trade market reversals and retracements
• Universal Rule: Always enter WITH the trend in both paths
• Exit Protocol: STR-EXIT trend change on 1-hour timeframe

Wizs Rate Architecture - TRIPLE ENHANCEMENT SYSTEM
Target: 90-95% Win Rate Achievement
Layer 1: 34 Entry Conditions (Base: 65-70%)
• Function: Primary screening - catches 70% of bad trades
• Requirement: Minimum 10 conditions must trigger simultaneously
• Structure: A1-A3 (CT-Sell), B1-B3 (CT-Buy), C (PB-Sell), D (PB-Buy)

Layer 2: ML Enhancement (Enhanced: 80-85%)
• Function: Advanced pattern recognition - catches additional 15-20%
• Requirement: ML confidence 175% for trade approval
• Fallback: Mandatory when ML unavailable or VIX >30

Layer 3: Candlestick + Volume (Final: 90-95%)

• Function: Final validation - catches remaining 10-15O/oof bad trades

• Requirement: Strong directional candlestick + volume confirmation
• Timing: Must be present at bar-close on entry timeframes (15M/5M)

CRITICAL EXCLUSIONS (PERMANENTLY LOCKED)
•  NO Elliott Wave Analysis - Completely removed from all logic
•  NO Fibonacci Confluence - All Fibonacci components excluded
•  Rules 1-399 Superseded - Only Rules 400-500+ are authoritative

 DUAL MARKET ARCHITECTURE
IN INDIAN fi&O MARKETS
System Type: Background Scanner	Dynamic Secondary Chart Creation Data Sources:
• Fyers API: India VIX, real-time F&0 data, order execution
• TrueData API: NSE/BSE option chain analysis, live market data
Chart Management Protocol:

•  NO Primary Charts - Pure background scanning approach
•  Direct Secondary Chart Opening - Call/Put charts at OTM levels
 • Auto-lifecycle: Stop loss/exit/take profit OR 3:29 PM expiry closure Strike Price Configuration:
• NIFTY INDEX: 50-point intervals
• All Other Indices: 100-point intervals
• Stock Options: Dynamic interval detection based on market data
Hybrid OI Logic Implementation:
Step 1: Trend Path Qualification

• Scan for Continuation Path (CT) OR Pullback Path (PB)
• Proceed to ATM analysis when either path triggers at bar close
Step 2: ATM Strike Identification
• ATM = Nearest to current spot price AND nearest to bar-close price

• Analysis range: 5 levels above and below ATM

Step 3: Dual Path OI Bias Evaluation Path A - Directional Bias Pattern:
• Bullish: ATM >30% Call OI bias + +1-OTM Call OI >30% more than Put OI
• Action: Call chart @ +1-OTM + Put chart @ -1-OTM
• Bearish: ATM >30% Put OI bias + -1-OTM Put OI >30% more than Call OI
    • Action: Put chart @ -1-OTM + Call chart @ +1-OTM Path B - Independent Bias Pattern:
• +1-OTM: >30% relative difference (any direction)
• -1-OTM: >30% relative difference (any direction)
• Action: Call chart @ +1-OTM + Put chart @ -1-OTM
Special Protocols:
• Expiry Day Override: Both charts open at ATM level
• Chart Limits: Maximum 1 Call + 1 Put chart per ATM strike
• Trading Timeframes: 5-min or 15-min execution only

 EXPIRY DAY PROTOCOL (CRITICAL UPDATE)
CONTINUE TRADING Approach (NOT Avoid)
Last 2 Hours Protocol (1:30 PM - 3:30 PM IST}:

•  Apply ALL 34 Entry Conditions without modification
•  Use ML Enhancement (may have lower confidence during volatility)
•  MANDATORY Dual Enhancement (Candlestick + Volume REQUIRED)
•  Fixed Stop Loss (0.25% from STR-EXIT on 1H timeframe)
•  Auto-Close at 3:29 PM (all positions and secondary charts)

Rationale for Continued Trading:

1. Best Opportunities: Expiry day volatility creates premium setups
2. Enhanced Protection: Dual enhancement filters eliminate weak entries
3. Fixed Risk: Predetermined stops protect against gamma squeeze
4. Quality Focus: Stricter requirements ensure only highest-probability trades
