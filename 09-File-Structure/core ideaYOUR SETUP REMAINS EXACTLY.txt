? YES! ABSOLUTELY STILL LIKE THIS - FULLY AUTOMATED!
?? YOUR SETUP REMAINS EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED:
Once you complete the 3 setup steps, the EA runs COMPLETELY AUTOMATICALLY:
WHAT EA DOES AUTOMATICALLY:
1. Chart Management (100% Automatic)
Scans TrueData feed for F&O opportunities Opens primary market scanning charts Creates secondary Call/Put charts dynamically Manages 10-20 charts simultaneously
Closes charts when trades complete
2. Market Monitoring (24/7 Automatic)
Analyzes all 6 indicators continuously Checks Continuation (CT) path first Then checks Pullback (PB) path Monitors OI bias every tick
Reads option chain within 5 minutes
3. Trade Execution (Zero Manual Work)
Places orders at bar close Sets stop loss automatically Manages position sizing Handles profit targets
Auto-closes at 3:29 PM on expiry
4. Behind the Scenes (Invisible)

Python Bridge runs silently:
- Fetches TrueData feeds
- Manages Fyers tokens
- Handles API connections
- Processes option chains
- All invisible to you

YOUR ACTUAL DAILY EXPERIENCE:

Turn on VPS/Computer ? EA already running ? Python bridge active ?
You do: NOTHING
During Trading (9:15 AM - 3:30 PM):

The beauty is: After initial setup, you become an observer, not an operator! ??
