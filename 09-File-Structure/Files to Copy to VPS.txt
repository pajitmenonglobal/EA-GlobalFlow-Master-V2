Files to Copy to VPS:
1. EA Files (Will be created later):

C:\MTS_IC_Markets\MQLS\Experts\
f--- EA GlobalFlow Pro v8.0.mq5
L_	EA GlobalFlow Pro v8.0.set (settings file)

2. Indicator Files (From project knowledge):

3. Python Bridge Files (Will be created):

C:\EA_GlobalFlow_Bridge\
f--- Python\ (created by venv command)
f--- totp_autologin.py f--- truedata_bridge.py f--- fyers_bridge.py

f--- config.json (with your API credentials)
L_	requirements.txt

4. Credentials File (Create this):

 Important Notes:
1. Nothing needs copying YET - Most files will be created during setup
2. Indicator files - I can provide these when needed
3. Python files - Will be created after Python installation
4. EA main file - Will be built last
For now, just install Python and MT5 on VPS. Files come later!
