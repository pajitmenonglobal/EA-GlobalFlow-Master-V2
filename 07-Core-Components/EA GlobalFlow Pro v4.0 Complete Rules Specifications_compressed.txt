zN Indian F&O Dynamic Chart Management
ATM Strike Selection Process
1. Get Spot Price from base symbol (NIFTY, BANKNIFTY, etc.)
2. Find ATM Strike: Nearest to spot price AND nearest to bar-close spot price
3. OI Analysis: >30O/odirectional bias requirement
4. Chart Creation: Open Call and Put charts at determined strikes

Hybrid OI Logic Flow
Step 1: Trend Path Qualification

• Scan for Continuation Path (CT) OR Pullback Path (PB)
• When either CT or PB is true at bar close	Proceed to ATM analysis

Step 2: ATM Strike Identification
 • ATM Strike = Nearest to current spot price AND nearest to bar-close spot price Step 3: Hybrid OI Bias Evaluation
• PATH 1 - Directional Bias:
• Bullish: ATM >30% Call OI + +1-OTM Call OI >30% more than Put OI
• Bearish: ATM >30% Put OI + -1-OTM Put OI >30% more than Call OI
• PATH 2 - Independent Bias:
• +1-OTM: >30% relative difference (any direction)
• -1-OTM: >30% relative difference (any direction)

Strike Price Intervals
• NIFTY INDEX: 50 point intervals
• ALL OTHER INDICES/STOCKS: 100 point intervals
• Stock Options: Varying intervals (auto-detected)

 Non-F&0 Market Management
Market Scanner Process
1. Market Detection: Automatically identify Forex/Commodities/CFDs
2. Multi-Timeframe Analysis: Major (Daily/4H)	Middle (1H/30M)	Entry (5M/15M)
3. Path Analysis: Both Continuation (CT) and Pull-back (PB) paths
4. Enhancement Scoring: Based on confluence of all indicators
