 CORE STRATEGY FRAMEWORK
Strategy Name: lchimoku-TDI-PA-BBsqueeze-Kumocross Objective: Multi-market trading system for trending markets

• Path 1: Continuation (CT) - trade with ongoing trends

• Path 2: Pull-back (PB) - trade market reversals

• Exit Rule: STR-EXIT trend change on 1-hour timeframe

• Universal Entry Rule: ALWAYS enter with the trend in BOTH paths


 WIN  RATE ARCHITECTURE {LOCKED)

 TRIPLE ENHANCEMENT SYSTEM - 90-95% WIN RATE
Layer 1: 34 Entry Conditions

• Base Win Rate: 65-70%

• Function: Basic screening - catches 70% of bad trades

• Requirement: Minimum 10 conditions must be met

Layer 2: ML Enhancement

• Enhanced Win Rate: 80-85%

• Function: Advanced filtering - catches another 15-20%

• Requirement: ML confidence 2:: 75%

Layer 3: Candlestick + Volume Validation

• Final Win Rate: 90-95% 
• Function: Final inspection - catches last 10-15%

• Requirement: Strong candlestick pattern + volume confirmation

 FALLBACK SYSTEM
• When ML Fails: 34 Conditions+ MANDATORY Candlestick+ Volume= 80-85%

• VIX >30: Disable ML, use strict candlestick patterns= 85%

• Baseline: 34 conditions alone = 65-70%


 CRITICAL EXCLUSIONS (NEVER IMPLEMENT)

COMPLETELY EXCLUDED FROM EA LOGIC:
•  Elliott Wave Analysis - All references removed
•  Fibonacci Confluence - All Fibonacci components excluded
•  Rules 1-399 - Outdated/superseded concepts only
•  Primary Chart Dependencies - F&O uses background scanner only

AUTHORITATIVE RULE SET:
•  Rules 400-500+ ONLY - Latest evolved advanced framework
•  Pure Technical Analysis - 6 indicators + ML+ Price Action only


 DUAL MARKET ARCHITECTURE

IN F&O MARKETS (Indian)

 HYBRID 01 LOGIC (F&O ONLY)

ATM STRIKE IDENTIFICATION

• ATM Strike = Nearest to current spot price AND nearest to bar-close spot price

• Study 5 levels above and below ATM price

DUAL PATH 01 ANALYSIS
PATH 1: Directional Bias Pattern

• Bullish: ATM > 30% Call 01 bias + +1-OTM Call 01 > 30% more than Put 01
• Action: Open Call chart @ + 1-OTM + Put chart @ -1-OTM

• Bearish: ATM > 30% Put 01 bias + -1-OTM Put 01 > 30% more than Call 01
• Action: Open Put chart @ -1-OTM + Call chart @ +1-OTM

PATH 2: Independent Bias Pattern

•	+1-OTM: > 30% relative difference (any direction)

• -1-OTM: >30% relative difference (any direction)

• Action: Open Call chart @ +1-OTM + Put chart @ -1-OTM

SPECIAL RULES

• Expiry Day: Both charts open at ATM level (overrides OTM logic)

• Chart Limits: Only 1 Call + 1 Put chart per ATM strike

• Minimum Bias: 30% threshold is NEVER compromised

• Auto-Close: 3:29 PM on expiry day mandatory


 RISK MANAGEMENT & SAFETY
RISK VETO SYSTEM (Can Cancel Any Trade)

• Economic: 30 min before/after high-impact news

• Market Conditions: First/last 30 minutes, extreme volatility (ATR > 3x)

• Technical: Conflicting signals, support/resistance < 20 pips

• Liquidity: Avoid far OTM, illiquid strikes, expiry day drops

STR-EXIT PROTOCOL (SACRED)

• Exit Trigger: STR-EXIT trend direction change on 1H timeframe

• Trailing Buffer: 0.25% from STR-EXIT line

• Volatility Adjustment: Dynamic buffer based on ATR

• Override: Never compromise STR-EXIT logic

POSITION LIMITS
• Max Risk: 5% per trade (conservative)

• Daily Loss Limit: Customizable parameter

• Position Limits: Market-specific maximums

• Emergency Stops: Multiple circuit breakers


 EXPIRY DAV PROTOCOL (CRITICAL UPDATE)

 IMPORTANT CORRECTION
• OLD (Incorrect): Avoid new trades in last 2 hours

• NEW (Correct): CONTINUE TRADING in last 2 hours with FULL EA rules

EXPIRY DAY LAST 2 HOURS (1:30 PM - 3:30 PM 1ST)
•  Continue Scanning for Opportunities
•  Apply ALL 34 Entry Conditions
•  Use ML if Available (may have lower confidence)
• MANDATORY Dual Enhancement (Candlestick+ Volume REQUIRED)

•  Fixed Stop Loss (0.25% from STR-EXIT 1H)
•  Auto-close at 3:29 PM

WHY THIS MAKES SENSE
1. Best Opportunities: Expiry day volatility creates excellent setups

2. Enhanced Protection: Dual enhancement filters out weak trades

3. Fixed Stops: Protects against gamma squeezes

4. Quality Entries: Candlestick + Volume ensures only best trades
