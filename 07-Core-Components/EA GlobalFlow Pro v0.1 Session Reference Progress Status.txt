2. 01 Analysis Timing _, Continuous during market hours
3. Multiple Signal Handling _, Fund-balance based, maximum allowed charts with triple enhancement
4. 01 Calculation Formula _, Hybrid logic - PATH 1 (Directional Bias) OR PATH 2 (Independent Bias)

6. ATM Strike Selection _, Option B: Choose nearest to spot price
7. Expiry Day Override _, Option A: From market open (9:30 AM)
8. Auto-Close Priority _, First occurrence wins (Stop Loss/Take Profit/3:29 PM/Position Limits)
9. Fund-Balance Limits_, Entry rules based+ Same-day ATM/OTM restriction+ Trade direction customization
10. Maximum Chart Limits _, YES - Absolute maximum to prevent system overload
11. Visual Updates _, Option A - Every tick (real-time strike price, 01 bias %, P&L display)

F&O TRADE DIRECTION CUSTOMIZATION - COMPLETE

• VIX > 30 protocol adjustments

• Bar-close timing alignment

• Real-time processing optimization

MODULE SET 3: 34 ENTRY CONDITIONS EXECUTION

 CURRENT PRIORITY: TRADE ENTRY CONDITION UPDATE

Status: DISCOVERY PHASE - New trade entry condition puzzle identified
Impact: Affects both EA code integration and indicator standardization
Action Required: Integration of new discovery into existing 34 entry conditions framework

Dependencies:

1. EA Code Integration - Core trade entry logic update

2. Indicator Standardization - Variable naming alignment

3. Compatibility Check - With existing F&O logic and Triple Enhancement System

Hybrid 01 Logic (F&O Only)

ATM Strike Identification:

• ATM Strike = Nearest to current spot price AND nearest to bar-close spot price

• Study 5 levels above and below ATM price

Dual Path 01 Analysis:

PATH 1: Directional Bias Pattern

• Bullish: ATM >30% Call 01 bias + +1-OTM Call 01 >30% more than Put 01
• Action: Open Call chart @ + 1-OTM + Put chart @ -1-OTM

• Bearish: ATM >30% Put 01 bias + -1-OTM Put 01 >30% more than Call 01
• Action: Open Put chart @ -1-OTM + Call chart @ + 1-OTM

PATH 2: Independent Bias Pattern

•	+1-0TM: >30% relative difference (any direction)

• -1-0TM: >30% relative difference (any direction)

• Action: Open Call chart @ +1-OTM + Put chart @ -1-OTM

Special Rules:

• Expiry Day: Both charts open at ATM level (overrides OTM logic)

• Chart Limits: Only 1 Call + 1 Put chart per ATM strike

• Minimum Bias: 30% threshold is NEVER compromised

• Auto-Close: 3:29 PM on expiry day mandatory

5. Exit Rules: STR-EXIT based system mandatory
