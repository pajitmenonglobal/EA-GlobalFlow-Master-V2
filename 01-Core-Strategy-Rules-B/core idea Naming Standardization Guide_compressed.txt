EA GlobalFlow Pro v8.0 - Naming Standardization Guide
Project Overview
Objective: Standardize all indicator buffer names to match EA shortened naming convention for seamless integration without translation layers.
Current Naming Convention (EA Standard)
Ichimoku Indicator Buffers
- Tenkan-sen (currently ExtTenkanBuffer)
- Kijun-sen (currently ExtKijunBuffer)
- Senkou Span A (currently ExtSpanA_Buffer)
- Senkou Span B (currently ExtSpanB_Buffer)
- Chikou Span (currently ExtChikouBuffer)

TDI (Ichi-Trader Dynamic Index) Buffers
- RSI Price Line (currently MaBuf)
- Market Base Line (currently MdZone)
- Trade Signal Line (currently MbBuf)
- Upper Volatility Band (currently UpZone)
- Lower Volatility Band (currently DnZone)

Bollinger Bands Buffers
- Upper Band (currently ExtUpperBuffer)
- Lower Band (currently ExtLowerBuffer)
- Middle Band (currently ExtMovingBuffer) [if needed]

SMMA50 Buffer
- 50-period SMMA (currently ExtLineBuffer)

Supertrend Buffers
- Supertrend Entry (ATR 1.0)
- Supertrend Exit (ATR 1.5)

Implementation Checklist
For Each Indicator:
 Replace buffer array names with standardized names  Update SetIndexBuffer() calls with new names
 Update all references in OnCalculate()
 Update any helper functions using these buffers  Update comments to reflect new names
 Test compilation for errors

For the EA:
 Ensure array declarations match exactly
 Remove any translation/mapping functions  Direct CopyBuffer() calls without remapping  Test complete integration
Benefits of Standardization
1. Direct Connection: No translation layer needed
2. Better Performance: No mapping overhead
3. Cleaner Code: Consistent naming throughout
4. Easier Maintenance: One naming convention
5. Reduced Errors: No confusion about buffer mappings

Next Steps for New Chat
1. Start new chat with reference: "Continue EA GlobalFlow Pro v8.0 naming standardization"
2. Attach or paste indicators one at a time
3. Apply changes from this guide
4. Test integration with EA

Important Notes
 All buffer names must match EXACTLY (case-sensitive)  Update both declaration and all usage points
 Maintain original buffer indices for SetIndexBuffer()  Keep original indicator functionality intact
This guide ensures perfect synchronization between EA GlobalFlow Pro v8.0 and all its indicators through standardized naming conventions.
