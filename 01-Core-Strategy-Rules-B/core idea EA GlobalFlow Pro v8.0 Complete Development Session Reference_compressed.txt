?? Strategy Core: Ichimoku-TDI-PA-BBsqueeze-Kumocross
A. Trading Paths (Both Markets)
1. Continuation Path (CT) - Trading with the trend
2. Pullback Path (PB) - Trading market reversals
Key Rules:
  Entry is ALWAYS with the trend in both paths
 Exit when trend changes in 1-hour timeframe using  Strike intervals: NIFTY INDEX = 50 points, Others
?? PART A: F&O MARKETS (Indi
1. Market Scanning Process

Step 1: Identify market type (Futures/Index Options/Stock Options) Step 2: Find CT or PB paths using multi-timeframe analysis
Step 3: Check Major trend (Daily/4H) ? Middle trend (1H/30M) Step 4: When conditions met at bar close ? Read option chain

2. ?? HYBRID ATM/OTM LOGIC (Crit
ATM Strike Identification:
 Nearest to current spot price AND near  On expiry day: Use ATM only (override

Hybrid OI Bias Evaluation - Two Parallel Paths: PATH 1: Directional Bias Pattern
Bullish Pattern:
- ATM: >30% relative Call OI bias
- +1-OTM: Call OI >30% more than Put OI (absolute)
? ACTION: Open Call chart @ +1-OTM + Put chart @ -1-OTM

Bearish Pattern:
- ATM: >30% relative Put OI bias
- -1-OTM: Put OI >30% more than Call OI (absolute)
? ACTION: Open Put chart @ -1-OTM + Call chart @ +1-OTM

PATH 2: Independent Bias Pattern

- +1-OTM: >30% relative difference (any direction)
- -1-OTM: >30% relative difference (any direction)
? ACTION: Open Call chart @ +1-OTM + Put chart @ -1-OTM

Key Points:
 It's an OR logic, not sequential
  Always opens exactly 2 charts (1 Call + 1 Put)
 Both conditions must be satisfied without compromise  Study 5 levels above and below ATM
