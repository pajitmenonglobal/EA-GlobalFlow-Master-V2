SPECIFIC TESTING PROTOCOLS

F&O Secondary Chart Testing Protocol


SECONDARY CHART VALIDATION:


Test Scenario 1: Strong 01 Bias
Setup: NIFTY with >30% Call 01 bias
Expected: Call chart opens at +1 OTM, Put chart at -1 OTM Verify: Visual themes (Green/Red), badges visible
Monitor: EA running on both charts
L-	Result:	Charts open correctly


Test Scenario 2: Weak 01 Bias
Setup: NIFTY with <30% 01 bias Expected: No secondary charts open
Verify: Debug log shows "01 bias not qualified" Monitor: Primary chart continues scanning
L-	Result:	No charts opened (correct behavior)


Test Scenario 3: Expiry Day
Setup: Trading on expiry day
Expected: Both charts open at ATM strike Verify: Override OTM logic, ATM strikes only Monitor: Auto-close at 3:29 PM exactly
L-	Result:	Expiry logic working


Test Scenario 4: Auto-Close Testing
Trigger 1: Manual 3:29 PM simulation Trigger 2: 3-trade limit reached Trigger 3: Stop loss hit
Trigger 4: Inactivity timeout (1 hour)
L-	Result:	All auto-close triggers working
