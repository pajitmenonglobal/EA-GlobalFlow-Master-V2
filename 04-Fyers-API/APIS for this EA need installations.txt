DOES THIS TRUEDATA API AND ALL OTHER APl'S for this EA need installations ?

No, APis themselves don't need "installation" -they are web services. Here's the difference:
 What You Install vs What You Connect To:
What Gets INSTALLED (on your VPS):
 Python libraries (via pip install)
• These are tools to CONNECT to APis

• Like:	,

What You DON'T Install Gust connect to):
 APis (web services)
• TrueData API	Lives on TrueData servers
• Fyers API	Lives on Fyers servers
• CFTC COT Data	Lives on government website

 Think ofit like this:
Python Library = Phone app (you install)
API = Phone service (you connect to)

For EA GlobalFlow Pro:
1. You INSTALL:
• Python libraries (pip install commands)
• These create the "connection tools"

2. You CONNECT TO:
• TrueData servers (for market data)
• Fyers servers (for trading)
• No installation needed!

3. You CONFIGURE:
• API credentials (username/password)
• Put these in EA settings

Summary: APis are like websites - you don't install Google, you just connect to it. Same with trading APis!
