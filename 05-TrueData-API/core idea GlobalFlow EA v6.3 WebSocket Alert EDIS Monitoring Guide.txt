GlobalFlow EA v6.3 ULTIMATE - WebSocket Alert & EDIS Monitoring System
?? Complete EDIS Alert Response Framework
Why EDIS Alerts Matter for Indian Markets
EDIS (Electronic Delivery Instruction Slip) is critical for Indian F&O trading as it manages delivery obligations when options expire in-the-money. Our EA now provides intelligent automated responses to EDIS system alerts to protect your trading operations.

?? Conservative Mode for PENDING Alerts
Reasoning: When EDIS delivery is pending, there's uncertainty about obligation fulfillment
Action: Reduce risk exposure while maintaining trading capability
Benefit: Protects against potential delivery issues while allowing profitable trading

?? Pause Trading for SHORTAGE Alerts
Reasoning: Delivery shortage indicates insufficient securities for obligati
Action: Prevent new positions that could compound deliver

Benefit: Stops accumulating additional delivery obligations

?? Emergency Mode for FAILURE Alerts
Reasoning: EDIS failure is critical - delivery obligations cannot be met Action: Immediate position closure to prevent regulatory issues Benefit: Minimizes penalties and regulatory complications


?? WebSocket Architecture Implementation
Connection Management

cpp

struct WebSocketManager
{
bool isConnected;
string serverURL;    // "wss://alerts.fyers.in/ws"

?? Multi-Level Response Frame
Response Mode Hierarchy
Level 1: Information Only
Trigger: Low-priority alerts, status upda

Action: Log message, continue normal operations
Use Case: General system notifications

Level 2: Conservative Adjustment
Trigger: EDIS pending, minor risk events
Action: Reduce position sizes, increase stop losses
Use Case: Proactive risk reduction

Level 3: Trading Suspension
Trigger: EDIS shortage, high-risk events
Action: Pause new trades, cancel pending orders
Use Case: Prevent risk accumulation

Level 4: Emergency Response
Trigger: EDIS failure, critical system alerts Action: Close all positions, disable trading Use Case: Immediate risk elimination
